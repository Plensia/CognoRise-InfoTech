# Simple Todo List App üóíÔ∏è

Hey there! This is a straightforward todo list app I built using vanilla JavaScript. Nothing fancy - just a clean, simple way to keep track of your tasks.

## What it does 
- Add tasks with a click or hit Enter
- Mark tasks as done (so satisfying!)
- Edit tasks when you made a typo or want to update them
- Delete tasks you don't need anymore
- Saves your tasks automatically (uses localStorage, so they'll stick around even if you close your browser)

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (no frameworks used!)
- Bootstrap Icons for those neat little buttons
- Google Fonts (Poppins - because pretty fonts matter)

## Want to make it better?

Feel free to fork it and add your own touches! Some ideas:
- Add categories for tasks
- Add due dates
- Make it prettier (though it's already pretty cute if you ask me)
- Whatever else you think would be cool!

## Known Quirks

- The checked/unchecked images are not in the same folder as index.html (I named them 'checked.png' and 'unchecked.webp')
- Works best in modern browsers (sorry Internet Explorer!)

## License

Feel free to use this however you want!
